# Fermi-Hubbard Model Simulation using fPEPS

This repository contains a Python implementation for simulating the **Fermi-Hubbard model** on 2D lattices using **Fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS)**. It also includes **Exact Diagonalization (ED)** codes for benchmarking small systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to explore the ground state properties of strongly correlated fermionic systems governed by the Hubbard Hamiltonian. The code utilizes Finite Fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States to efficiently represent the many-body wavefunction in two dimensions, overcoming the exponential scaling of Hilbert space encountered in exact diagonalization.
